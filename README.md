# Air-Quality-Analysis

 
### Business Problem

Urban and industrial growth have led to severe air pollution challenges, impacting public health and climate. However, monitoring this pollution and understanding pollutant behavior over time is difficult without structured insights. 

### 1. Description

The Air Quality Data Analysis project is a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization effort aimed at understanding air quality trends using pollutant-level data. It helps identify areas with critical pollution, daily/seasonal variations, and the relationship between air pollutants and time.

### 2. Tech Stack

The project was built using the following tools and technologies:

• 🐍 Python – For data manipulation and exploratory analysis

• 🧪 Jupyter Notebook – For executing EDA and visualizations

• 📊 pandas – For structured data manipulation & visualization

• 📁 CSV File – Raw air quality dataset (air-quality-data.csv)


### 3. Data Source

Source: [Open Government Data / Environmental Monitoring Stations]

This dataset contains timestamped air quality data across multiple locations. It includes levels of key pollutants  PM2.5 along with station details and timestamps.
